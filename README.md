# CryptoVC

CryptoVC introduces a revolutionary approach to transparent and trustless investments in the world of cryptocurrencies.

We believe that Crypto Natives should be funded by Crypto Natives onchain.

CryptoVC is deployed to Goerli for testing: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x662806c86678dd086bb6b2f37a18ff6ece94b28c

On smart contract side:

- when creating a project some ETH collateral is required, which [will be sent to Sparklend pool](https://github.com/yabalaban/ethglobal-online-oct/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/CryptoVC.sol#L122) in [exchange for DAI](https://github.com/yabalaban/ethglobal-online-oct/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/CryptoVC.sol#L126), also [ERC-20 smart-contract will be deployed](https://github.com/yabalaban/ethglobal-online-oct/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/CryptoVC.sol#L156) for project shares allocation
- [DAI is automatically converted to sDAI](https://github.com/yabalaban/ethglobal-online-oct/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/CryptoVC.sol#L128) to accumulate the interest during fundraise
- project then can be partially funded in DAI
- when funded in full
  - all DAI funding is pooled from the investors and [converted to sDAI](https://github.com/yabalaban/ethglobal-online-oct/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/CryptoVC.sol#L272) to accumulate interest
  - at the same time ERC-20 project shares are distributed on pro-rata basis
  - and [Safe multi-sig is deployed](https://github.com/yabalaban/ethglobal-online-oct/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/CryptoVC.sol#L275-L289) with investors and the creator as signers
- after funding succeeded the creator can request a tranche of funds
  - creator should first propose a request tranche transaction to project Safe for everyone to sign
  - when signed and executed â€“ [UMA assertion is posted to confirm the project status](https://github.com/yabalaban/ethglobal-online-oct/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/CryptoVC.sol#L207-L217)
  - if no challenged and settled, then the tranche will be [withdrawn from sDAI](https://github.com/yabalaban/ethglobal-online-oct/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/CryptoVC.sol#L245) and sent as DAI to the creator

On webapp side:

- the app allows to interact with CryptoVC smart-contract functions
- it also allows to propose the project Safe transactions by the creator via Safe API SDK
- all the data is fetched via subgraph based on dedicated subgraph (via thegraph)
- project metadata is stored in ipfs via web3.storage
- we also use Next.ID by Mask Network to fetch identity information about project creators
- push.org is used to send project notifications
- xmtp is used to handle communication between creator and investors
